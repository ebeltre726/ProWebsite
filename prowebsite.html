        <!-- Information on why Birds have the above qualities-->
        <h2>So Why Have These Qualities?</h2>
        <h4>FEATHERS</h4>
        <p>Every bird has some type of feathers, even those that do not fly.
            Just because a bird cannot fly, doesn't mean it is not a bird. Birds have
            feathers for many reasons, but the most common reasons are camouflage, flight, warmth,
            and to keep them dry.
        </p>
        <h4>HARD-SHELLED EGGS</h4>
        <p>All birds have hard-shelled eggs. The reason for this is not entirely clear,
            but one can assume that having harder shelled eggs allows for better durability.
            The reason a bird might want to have harder shelled eggs is for their nesting conditions.
            Usually birds have nests in higher areas like trees and even small buildings. If the egg
            were to fall, it may break, but it has a less chance of breaking or damaging the chick if the egg
            is harder shelled.
        </p>
        <h4>HOLLOW BONES</h4>
        <p>In the wild, you may think having hollow bones would be a great disadvantage. Not only does
            this make you weaker, but it can also lead to more frequent and severe injuries, so why do
            all birds have this quality? The main reason is for flight, and agility. Not all 
            birds fly, but most birds are not as territorial as other larger and bigger animals unless
            they are protecting their young. Because of this, they always need a method of escape, and
            having hollow bones gives them the ability to do just that.
        </p>

                <td>New Zealand</td>
                <td style="text-align:left;">Kiwi's are a symbol of New Zealand, and Many
                    New Zealanders call each other Kiwis. The Kiwi Bird
                    is a bipedal bird with wings that are almost transparent to the eye.
                    It is flightless, lays eggs almost half of its size, and has a long beak for 
                    eating insects.

                <td>Africa</td>
                <td style="text-align:left;">Ostriches are native to Africa, and are known for their massive size.
                    As mentioned before, although they have this size, they are still vulnerable to
                    the bigger and stronger animals in the region such as hippos, rhinos, and lions. The 
                    Ostrich makes up for this with it's ability to kick with devastating force, and also 
                    run at speeds of 43mph.

                <td>Antarctica</td>
                <td style="text-align:left;">Penguins are native to Antarctica, where the climate is very cold. They have a thick layer of
                    insulative, rigid, and waterproof feathers that allows them to swim, and also slide through the
                    snow on their bellies by tobagganing. There are around 8 species of Penguin in Antarctica,
                    however the most common penguin known to most is the Emperor penguin, with a black and white body
                    and the occasional yellow marks around their necks.

        <!-- Conclusion -->
        <h1>What To Take Away from This</h1>
        <br>
        <p>You may be asking, why is this important? What should I take away from understanding
            more about birds. The answer is simple, because of the misconceptions around birds. Many people
            believe birds have certain traits or birds follow certain actions, but they end up categorizing the wrong
            birds into the wrong groups. You now understand the main qualities that separate birds from other animals, and
            these distinctions allow you to be more level-headed when it comes to identifying a bird from another animal.
